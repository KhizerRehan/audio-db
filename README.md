# Dashboard for the AudioDB MVP Platform

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About
Here is a free API, build a simple site/app where a user can search an artist by using keywords. Then if the user clicks on the Artist, it will display Itâ€™s album list plus any other information you want to show

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

## npm install

## node version
- v18.19.0
## npm version
10.2.3

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

- Default landing page should be Artist with `coldplay` as the default search keyword

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
